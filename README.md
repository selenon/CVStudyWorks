# CVStudyWorks

A collection of hands-on scripts and projects to explore computer vision using Python and OpenCV.

## Contents

This repository gathers various study notes, code samples, and small projects built while learning and experimenting with OpenCV3 and Python 3. Each script is self-contained and focuses on a specific computer vision topic or technique.

### Scripts and Projects
- Corner detection (Harris algorithm)
- Screen recording with OpenCV
- Image inpainting (FMM, NS methods)
- 2D histogram plotting
- Trackbar UI in OpenCV windows
- Background subtraction (MOG, GMG)
- Finding brightest and dullest image regions
- Canny edge detection (images and video)
- Color detection logic
- Colored and grayscale image histograms
- Histogram equalization
- Reading and displaying images
- Image masking
- Image thresholding
- Image gradients (Sobel, Scharr, Laplacian)
- Webcam video loading
- Mouse event handling for images
- Region selection in images
- Image resizing
- Capture and save video
- High-pass and low-pass image smoothing
- Camshift and Meanshift algorithms (video tracking)
- CLAHE (adaptive histogram equalization)
- Circle detection (HoughCircles)
- Contour detection
- Line detection (HoughLinesP)
- Normal/mixed seamless cloning
- Overlay transparent images
- Reverse video creator
- Image rotation
